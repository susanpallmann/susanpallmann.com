Mrs Eaves is a transitional serif typeface designed by Zuzana Licko of Emigre. The typeface is based on Baskerville with some more "feminine" curves and quirks added in, and named to honor one of the first women in graphic design and printmaking, Sarah Eaves. This poster design had a simple limitation: it must be double sided, with one side informational and the other conceptual.
