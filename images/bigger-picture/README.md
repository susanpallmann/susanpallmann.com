The goal of this project was to design, illustrate, and develop a website that informs users about the assistance zoos provide to global conservation work. In doing so, the website also needed to address the misconception that animals in zoos are unhappy or mistreated. It was also intended that the project take the user through a longer, storybook-like narrative.
