In Washington State, the harassment of bigfoot, sasquatch, or other undiscovered subspecies is a felony punishable by fine. This campaign is intended to spread awareness about the above "blue law" and encourage people to leave bigfoot alone. Rather than taking a negative tone, Best Foot Forward reframes the issue, instead inviting people to be kind to bigfoot or have good "bigfoot etiquette."
