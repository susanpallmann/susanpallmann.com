            <p>
              Some blurb about the project prompt here, preferably around fifty words or so. This should explain the goal of the project 
              itself AND my design, as the viewer probably cares about my intent more than what the project was really about. Besides, that 
              info isn't needed for personal projects.

            <h3>Final Design</h3>
            <p>
              This is where some thoughts on the final design belong. This section can probably be the longest, closer to one hundred words, 
              although preferably split into paragraphs to make it not suck to read.
              <br><br>
              Unlike the introduction, this will talk about the design features and how they accomplish the goal I established in the first 
              section. It might also be a good place to mention anything I learned over the course of the project.
              <br><br>
              Below will go any other images needed to really capture the project's scope, not unlike what I'd put in a contest entry.
