            An in-depth investigation of experimental methods of the design process within the context of designing effective visual communications.

            The concept put simply is a mobile game that turns the monsters of our life into much more approachable visual monsters for our game characters to fight, equipping them for battle along the way with encouragement and good preparation practices. The target audience is late high school and college age, but it is hoped that it is still usable for people outside of that age range, as I think people of any age could use a little help with getting things done.

            Crescendo is a fictitious concert hall. I thought a music arena might be an interesting organization to brand for because usually they don’t need to advertise themselves too heavily - the focus is on the musicians visiting, because everyone has heard of the venue already. Crescendo is a music theory term meaning to get louder, notated by an angle bracket of varying lengths, so it seemed like an appropriate name and unique marker.

          <p class="project_text">
            This project was a cross between two concepts that already fascinated me, built up and developed over time as I sat in traffic on my way home. The first concept that I had started playing with was the idea of a message that only becomes legible as the user interacts with it, although in my mind at this stage this looked more like a website or a popup book. The other concept that I was interested in was how things that look like ordinary decoration can be used for much more, especially to communicate. I keep a note page on my phone/laptop for ideas as they hit me, so I hurriedly wrote down parts of this idea at red lights and traffic stops, adding or changing it until the idea very much resembled my final product.

          <img style="width: 78vw" src="https://i.imgur.com/aHaUCi6.png"/>
          <p class="project_text">
            The planned concept for this project was to represent how mental illness affects function through interaction that is purposely difficult to use. Although I was not really able to explore more disruptive interaction in this week, the project does provide a framework for that in future expansion.
<br><br>
Much of this project split my interests and focus design-wise, which is also why the current product might look a little simple if one does not consider all of the 3D modeling and coding behind it. In fact, using typical white-space conventions, this project utilizes over 750 lines of code.
<br><br>
The discussion we had in class about storyline was used in this project as well. The overall experience of the user clicking through any given module was of course considered, but even minor elements like the hamburger animation were storyboarded.

            This project focused more on web marketing strategy by approaching the user’s realization of the campaign goal as a storyline-based navigation. The imagery was conceptually derived from a summer project and illustrated to allow for interesting web effects such as parallax (visible at supportzoos.com). Otherwise the website was kept minimal and warm to make the message approachable and easy to find. This cause also has a special place in my heart as I volunteer out in the Jefferson Memorial Forest on Saturdays.

          <img style="width: 78vw" src="https://i.imgur.com/9VBStml.png"/>
          <p class="project_text">
            My inquiry was a series of illustrated postcards themed around a road trip I took this summer. However, rather than focusing on a representational portrayal of these places, I elected to present rather how the memories feel to me. While this idea of memory post cards is something I want to turn into an ongoing series, the three I chose to do for this week are unified by a common aesthetic I find interesting and want to hold on to.

          <img style="width: 78vw" src="https://i.imgur.com/hsFfW9C.png"/>
          <p class="project_text">
            For this inquiry, I attempted to tackle the issue of food insecurity and malnutrition in college students by informing what healthy eating looks like, and explaining how to get this intake in a cost-effective way. I also took into account that my target audience is one that as a generation struggles immensely with depression and anxiety, so I tried to include recipes that are up front regarding effort and time commitment to make the task feel less daunting.
