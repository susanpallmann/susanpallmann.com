      <h3>Objective</h3>
     <p>In April of 2018, I designed and coded a website for the first time. Determined to learn more about HTML and CSS, I set out to create the whole thing from scratch, and quite honestly I fell in love the whole process of designing for the web. Even once I finished creating my portfolio website, I wanted to learn more, and chased every opportunity to keep practicing and experimenting.</p>
	    <p>Of course, six months of improving my web skills left me feeling that my initial website design was a little lacking. It's a little meta to write about on the site itself, but it needed some tuning up, so I set a few goals for the redesign:</p>
		<p>1. Improve accessibility and general organization.</p>
	    	<p>2. Alter the color scheme to something more inviting.</p>
	    	<p>3. Reorganize and improve imagery, where needed.</p>
	    	<p>4. Add subtle interactivity on supporting pages.</p>
	    	<p>5. General updates of content, where needed.</p>

			<h3>Design</h3>
			<p>Keeping in mind that a major goal of the redesign was organization, I decided to develop the consistent or repeated elements before anything else – typography and colors. This part didn't need to be done completely from scratch; some elements from my original design were worth keeping. I especially liked the interactive gradient, body text style, and salmon/orange colors from my original design. However, all of these could use some expansion and refinement, so that is where I began.</p>
	          <div class="blockquote"><p>I have always seen marked improvement after an unusual or ambitious project.</p></div>
	    <p>My original duo-tone color scheme got expanded to 4 major colors that would accent the salmon that was so prevalent on the site already. The new tones add a little more contrast and make everything a little less hard on the eyes. The original site only used one font family, Lato. Due to some independent exploration with condenscended sans-serifs, I decided to take the typography in a new direction and bring in Oswald and Playfair Display (sparingly) to give the typography some tasteful variety.</p>

	    <p>Once I had worked out a color/font combination that worked, it was time to venture into the less certain – accessibility and compatibility.</p>
      <div class="process"><p>Cross-device compatibility was something I was really focused on when I built this website the first time, and I found a creative way to achieve a really uniform look across every possible device with the use of view-height and view-width measurements. I used them for absolutely <u>everything</u>. The entire page was shown relative to view-height, and while it looked great on every device, there was one big problem.</p>
	      <p>You can't zoom in on a page that's completely relative to view-height. For people who cannot see smaller text, not being able to zoom raises accessibility concerns, so I knew that in the redesign I would need to find an alternative way to have my page adapt to the screen it's on.</p>
	      <div class="codesnip"><p>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</p></div>
	      <p>What a life-saver this turned out to be. In the original design, I had set my text to be relative to view-height, and while that generally made it readable, there remained the issue of not being able to zoom in. Using the above code in my HTML, and setting text sizes to percentages renders a comfortable size on all the devices I've tested, and bonus: you can zoom if it still isn't comfortable. Lesson learned.</p>
      </div>
	    <p>Separating these things with some text, because while they don't have any margins of their own, they would normally be surrounded in things that do have margins (like this paragraph) to make them look good. Not adding margins to the code style because they would interfere with the padding I've applied to my "Process" style. How cool are my code boxes, by the way?</p>
      <div class="codesnip"><p>String of code.</p></div>
	    <p>Not to keep bragging, but they also look fantastic on mobile. I think I'm finally learning responsive web design!</p>
