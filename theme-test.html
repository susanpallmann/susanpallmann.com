       <h1>Portfolio Redesign</h1>
	 <h4>Personal Project</h4>
      </div>
      <h3>Objective</h3>
     <p>In April of 2018, I designed and coded a website for the first time. Determined to learn more about HTML and CSS, I set out to create the whole thing from scratch, and quite honestly I fell in love the whole process of designing for the web. Even once I finished creating my portfolio website, I wanted to learn more, and chased every opportunity to keep practicing and experimenting.</p>
	    <p>Of course, six months of improving my web skills left me feeling that my initial website design needed some tuning up, so I set a few goals for the redesign:
	    </p>
	    <span class="numbered-list">
		<p>1. Improve accessibility and general organization.</p>
	    	<p>2. Alter the color scheme to something more inviting.</p>
	    	<p>3. Reorganize and improve imagery, where needed.</p>
	    	<p>4. Add subtle interactivity on supporting pages.</p>
	    	<p>5. General updates of content, where needed.</p>
	    </span>
	    <img src="" alt="Image">
      <p>For the previous project in this class, I had worked with LINK: Mrs. Eaves, so I aimed to make this project about something a little less traditional: Futura.</p>
			<h3>Experimentation</h3>
			<p>Especially in my student works, I try to make a point of pushing outside of what I'm comfortable with in design. I don't really believe you can improve without pushing past what you're used to, and in my own work I have always seen marked improvement after an unusual or ambitious project. This zine was certainly no exception to my trend of stepping outside my own lines, including extremely new to me techniques like costume-making and long-exposure photography.</p>
	    <p>However, this push into the unknown was only fitting for a typeface meant to embody futurism so strongly, and that futuristic theme resonated throughout the piece, from light-writing to an astronaut suit.</p>
      <div class="blockquote"><p>I have always seen marked improvement after an unusual or ambitious project.</p></div>
      <div class="process"><p>Some process text here.</p>
       <div class="codesnip"><p>String of code.</p></div>
      </div>
	    <p>Separating these things with some text, because while they don't have any margins of their own, they would normally be surrounded in things that do have margins (like this paragraph) to make them look good. Not adding margins to the code style because they would interfere with the padding I've applied to my "Process" style. How cool are my code boxes, by the way?</p>
      <div class="codesnip"><p>String of code.</p></div>
	    <p>Not to keep bragging, but they also look fantastic on mobile. I think I'm finally learning responsive web design!</p>
