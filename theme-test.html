      <h3>Challenge</h3>
     <p>As a part of my Typography I course, I was tasked with creating a short self-published magazine, or zine, about a particular typeface. There were some requirements for what kind of content had to be included, such as a poem, an experimental representation of the typeface, and my personal favorite, a photoshoot of yourself personifying that typeface.</p>
      <p>For the previous project for this class, I had worked with LINK: Mrs. Eaves, so I aimed to make this project about something a little less traditional: Futura.</p>
