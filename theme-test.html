       <h1>Futura Type Zine</h1>
       <h4>Print Design</h4>
      </div>
      <h3>Objective</h3>
     <p>As a part of Typography I, designers were tasked with creating a short self-published magazine, or zine, about a particular typeface. There were some requirements for what kind of content had to be included, such as a poem, an experimental representation of the typeface, and my personal favorite, a photoshoot of yourself personifying that typeface.</p>

      <p>For the previous project in this class, I had worked with LINK: Mrs. Eaves, so I aimed to make this project about something a little less traditional: Futura.</p>
			<h3>Experimentation</h3>
			<p>Especially in my student works, I try to make a point of pushing outside of what I'm comfortable with in design. I don't really believe you can improve without pushing past what you're used to, and in my own work I have always seen marked improvement after an unusual or ambitious project. This zine was certainly no exception to my trend of stepping outside my own lines, including extremely new things like costume-making and long-exposure photography.</p>
