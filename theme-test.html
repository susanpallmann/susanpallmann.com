       <h1>Portfolio Redesign</h1>
	 <h4>Personal Project</h4>
      </div>
      <h3>Objective</h3>
     <p>In April of 2018, I designed and coded a website for the first time. Determined to learn more about HTML and CSS, I set out to create the whole thing from scratch, and quite honestly I fell in love the whole process of designing for the web. Even once I finished creating my portfolio website, I wanted to learn more, and chased every opportunity to keep practicing and experimenting.</p>
	    <p>Of course, six months of improving my web skills left me feeling that my initial website design was a little lacking. It's a little meta to write about on the site itself, but it needed some tuning up, so I set a few goals for the redesign:</p>
		<p>1. Improve accessibility and general organization.</p>
	    	<p>2. Alter the color scheme to something more inviting.</p>
	    	<p>3. Reorganize and improve imagery, where needed.</p>
	    	<p>4. Add subtle interactivity on supporting pages.</p>
	    	<p>5. General updates of content, where needed.</p>

			<h3>Design</h3>
			<p>Knowing that a major purpose of the redesign is organization, I decided to develop the consistent or repeated elements before anything else â€“ typography and colors.</p>
	    <p>This part didn't need to be done completely from scratch; some elements from my original design were worth keeping. I especially liked the interactivity, body text style, and salmon/orange gradiant from my original design. However, all of these could use some expansion and refinement, so that is where I began. My original duo-tone color scheme got expanded to 4 major colors that would accent the salmon that was so prevalent on the site already. The new tones add a little more contrast and make everything a little less hard on the eyes. The original site only used one font family. Due to some independent exploration with condenscended sans-serifs, I decided to take the typography in a new direction and bring in Oswald and Playfair Display to give the typography some tasteful variety.</p>
      <div class="blockquote"><p>I have always seen marked improvement after an unusual or ambitious project.</p></div>
      <div class="process"><p>Some process text here.</p>
       <div class="codesnip"><p>String of code.</p></div>
      </div>
	    <p>Separating these things with some text, because while they don't have any margins of their own, they would normally be surrounded in things that do have margins (like this paragraph) to make them look good. Not adding margins to the code style because they would interfere with the padding I've applied to my "Process" style. How cool are my code boxes, by the way?</p>
      <div class="codesnip"><p>String of code.</p></div>
	    <p>Not to keep bragging, but they also look fantastic on mobile. I think I'm finally learning responsive web design!</p>
