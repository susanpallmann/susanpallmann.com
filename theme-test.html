       <h1>Futura Type Zine</h1>
       <h4>Print Design</h4>
      </div>
      <h3>Objective</h3>
     <p>As a part of Typography I, designers were tasked with creating a short self-published magazine, or zine, about a particular typeface. There were some requirements for what kind of content had to be included, such as a poem, an experimental representation of the typeface, and my personal favorite, a photoshoot of yourself personifying that typeface.</p>

      <p>For the previous project in this class, I had worked with LINK: Mrs. Eaves, so I aimed to make this project about something a little less traditional: Futura.</p>
			<h3>Experimentation</h3>
			<p>Especially in my student works, I try to make a point of pushing outside of what I'm comfortable with in design. I don't really believe you can improve without pushing past what you're used to, and in my own work I have always seen marked improvement after an unusual or ambitious project. This zine was certainly no exception to my trend of stepping outside my own lines, including extremely new to me techniques like costume-making and long-exposure photography.</p>
	    <p>However, this push into the unknown was only fitting for a typeface meant to embody futurism so strongly, and that futuristic theme resonated throughout the piece, from light-writing to an astronaut suit.</p>
      <div class="blockquote"><p>I have always seen marked improvement after an unusual or ambitious project.</p></div>
      <div class="process"><p>Some process text here.</p>
       <div class="codesnip"><p>String of code.</p></div>
      </div>
	    <p>Separating these things with some text, because while they don't have any margins of their own, they would normally be surrounded in things that do have margins (like this paragraph) to make them look good. Not adding margins to the code style because they would interfere with the padding I've applied to my "Process" style. How cool are my code boxes, by the way?</p>
      <div class="codesnip"><p><code><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"></code></p></div>
	    <p>Not to keep bragging, but they also look fantastic on mobile. I think I'm finally learning responsive web design! The code above fixed like 90% of my problems.</p>
